# Show usage limits in your app

Where an [entitlement](/billing/limits/lock-features/) is a yes/no switch, a **quota** is a metered allowance that a workspace (called a *tenant* in the API) can run down and hit: 10,000 AI calls a month, 20 seats. Quotas are **defined on the plan**; see [Define your plans](/billing/setup/define-plans/) for setting them. This page covers showing quota state in your app and reacting as usage climbs.

`<BridgeQuotaBanner>` warns users as they approach a metric's cap so a hard stop never comes as a surprise, and it nudges them to upgrade. It's a live usage-cap banner for one metric: it renders nothing while usage is below 80% of the plan's quota (or when the plan has no quota for that metric), shows a warning at 80–94%, critical at 95%+, and over-cap copy when the limit is exceeded. It updates live on `quota.updated` pushes.

```tsx
import { BridgeQuotaBanner } from '@nebulr-group/bridge-react';

<BridgeQuotaBanner metric="ai_completions" />
```

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `metric` | `string` | required | Metric key to watch |
| `label` | `string` | metric key | Humanized display label |
| `className` | `string` | `''` | Class applied to the root element |
| `onActionClick` | `(snap) => void` | (none) | Override the default Upgrade CTA handler |

## Reading quota state yourself

For a fully custom quota UI, read the underlying snapshot directly:

```ts
import { useBridgeBilling } from '@nebulr-group/bridge-react';

const q = useBridgeBilling().quota('ai_completions');
// undefined while loading (first call triggers a fetch), then:
// q?.used, q?.limit, q?.remaining, q?.warningLevel ('approaching' | 'critical' | null)
```

> **Note:** `useBridgeBilling` is the React SDK's re-export of the underlying `@nebulr-group/bridge-auth-core` package's `useBridge` billing surface. It's a temporary escape hatch: the React SDK doesn't yet expose quota state on the `bridge` object (and the `useBridge()` exported by `bridge-react` is a different function that returns the `bridge` object, without a `quota()` method). Until the SDK surfaces quotas, use this re-export for this one read.
